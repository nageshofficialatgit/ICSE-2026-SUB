  Expression: text = The principle of Freedom of the Nodes establishes that decentralized networks - when containing native assets, governed by open-source code, sufficiently decentralized, and universally accessible - may be freely used without conditions by every human being.

Containing Native Assets
Assets are considered native when they exist only on a decentralized network and independent of any single jurisdiction's legal system of rights and duties.

Governed by Open-Source Code
Governance by code means the decentralized network's protocol runs according to fixed parameters where only limited changes are possible and require acceptance from network participants to take effect. Open-source means anyone can download and suggest improvements to the network's code, and because no single person owns it, it does not fall under one jurisdiction.

Sufficiently Decentralized
Sufficiently decentralized means that the technology forms a decentralized network where no single person or identifiable group controls access to the technology, carries out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts, or can restrict specific transactions or exclude specific persons.

Universally Accessible
Universally accessible means that the technology supporting the decentralized network and its transactions must be publicly available through electronic devices without discrimination or special permission. All required software must be freely downloadable and any person may use the code and network to create applications for private or public purposes.
