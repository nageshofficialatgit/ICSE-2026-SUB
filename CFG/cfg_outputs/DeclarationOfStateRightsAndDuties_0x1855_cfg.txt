  Expression: text = PREAMBLE:

Whereas all states are equal in dignity and rights and represent the interests of their people, they should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood,

Considering that the equal and inalienable rights of all states are the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world,

Recognizing that states, as fundamental legal actors, embody collective free will and establish an international legal order,

Acknowledging that the international legal order poses opportunities and challenges to the self-determination of states and peoples, affecting the liberty of individuals,

Observing that the international legal order imposes duties upon states through undemocratic processes that violate sovereign equality, advance particular ideologies, and lack fundamental checks and balances,

Understanding that state rights and duties exist independent of the jurisdiction of any entity within the society of nations,

Article 1
Every state has the right to equality in law with every other state.

Article 2
Every state has the right to exercise jurisdiction over its territory and all persons and things therein.

Article 3
Every state has the right to independence and, therefore, to freely exercise all its legal powers without dictation by any other state, including the choice of its own form of government. Every state has the duty to respect the independence and form of government of all other states.

Article 4
Every state has the duty to treat all persons under its jurisdiction with respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and must prioritize these above other duties.

Article 5
Every state has the right to enter into treaties with other states and the duty to fulfill in good faith its treaty obligations.

The territory of a state is inviolable and may not be the object of military occupation nor of other measures of subversion or force by another state, whether imposed directly or indirectly, for any motive, even temporarily.

Every state has the duty to refrain from intervening in the internal or external affairs of any other state and from fomenting civil strife in the territory of another state.

Article 9
Every state has the duty to settle its disputes with other states by peaceful means and refrain from resorting to war as an instrument of national policy. States are to always observe established restrictions in the conduct of war.

Article 10
Every state has the right to individual or collective self-defense against armed attack and other forms of harmful interference in its sovereign affairs.
