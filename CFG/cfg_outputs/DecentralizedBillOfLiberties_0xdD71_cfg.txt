  Expression: text = PREAMBLE:

Whereas all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and are endowed with reason and conscience, they should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood,

Considering that the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world,

Recognizing that modern technology unites humanity across borders,

Observing that cross-border technology and governance both pose opportunities and challenges to individual freedoms to act,

Acknowledging that liberties, as fundamental rights, protect individual freedoms to act,

Affirming that liberties limit all forms of human governance and create a universal duty of respect for all persons and institutions - without granting authority to create obligations beyond their original scope,

Realizing the need for a bill of liberties that transcends jurisdictional limitations while applying equally to all,


CREATING AN IMMUTABLE RECORD OF THE FOLLOWING UNIVERSAL LIBERTIES:

Article 1
Every human being has the right to life, liberty, and the security of person, to bodily integrity, and to freedom from medical and scientific procedures without consent.

Article 2
Every human being has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion and to participate in cultural life, arts, and technological and scientific advancement.

Article 3
All human beings must be secure in their family, home, and correspondence; be free from attacks upon their honor and reputation; and have the right to privacy.

Article 4
All human beings are free to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, and to use their preferred language. All men and women are free and protected in founding and raising a family.

Article 5
Every human being has the right to freedom of opinion and expression and to freely obtain and share information regardless of medium.

Article 6
Every human being has the right to work and engage in economic activity; to acquire, own, use, and exchange property; and to transact freely in a medium of exchange of choice.

Article 7
Every human being has the right to assembly and association and to organize with others to pursue and protect their mutual interests.

Article 8
Every human being has the right to freedom of movement and residence.

Article 9

Article 10
No human being may be subjected to slavery or servitude, to torture, to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, or to sexual violence or exploitation.


REQUIREMENTS OF ALL LEGAL SYSTEMS:

All human beings have a right to a legal order where they are treated as equals before the law, enjoy equal protection from rights violations and arbitrary arrest or detention, and have an effective remedy against rights violations.

No one may be deprived of any liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as established by law, and no one may be held guilty of any penal offense which did not constitute a penal offense at the time when it was committed.

Everyone charged with a penal offense has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent, and impartial judiciary system; and, when deprived of their liberty, be treated with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.
