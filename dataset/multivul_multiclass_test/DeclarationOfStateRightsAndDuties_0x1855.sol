Every state has the duty to respect the independence and form of government of all other states.\n\nArticle 4\nEvery state has the duty to treat all persons under its jurisdiction with respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and must prioritize these above other duties.\n\nArticle 5\nEvery state has the right to enter into treaties with other states and the duty to fulfill in good faith its treaty obligations.\n\nArticle 6\nEvery state has the right to defend its integrity and independence; to provide for its conservation and prosperity; to consequently organize itself as it sees fit; to legislate upon its interests and administer its services; to define the jurisdiction and competence of its courts; and to regulate its economy and resources.\n\nArticle 7\nThe territory of a state is inviolable and may not be the object of military occupation nor of other measures of subversion or force by another state, whether imposed directly or indirectly, for any motive, even temporarily.\n\nArticle 8\nEvery state has the duty to refrain from intervening in the internal or external affairs of any other state and from fomenting civil strife in the territory of another state.\n\nArticle 9\nEvery state has the duty to settle its disputes with other states by peaceful means and refrain from resorting to war as an instrument of national policy. States are to always observe established restrictions in the conduct of war.\n\nArticle 10\nEvery state has the right to individual or collective self-defense against armed attack and other forms of harmful interference in its sovereign affairs.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER:\n\nNo state is subject to a permanent suprastate executive. A state of emergency cannot establish a permanent suprastate executive over a state. No state may be subject to a permanent international force. No state is subject to a permanent international court or regulatory body without its consent. No state may be taxed or regulated by non-state entities. No state may be denied its right to create and enforce its own laws, to engage in commerce and financial transactions, or to create and use a monetary system.";
