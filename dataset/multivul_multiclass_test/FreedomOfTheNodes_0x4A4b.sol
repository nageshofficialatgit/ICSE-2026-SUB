Open-source means anyone can download and suggest improvements to the network's code, and because no single person owns it, it does not fall under one jurisdiction.\n\nSufficiently Decentralized\nSufficiently decentralized means that the technology forms a decentralized network where no single person or identifiable group controls access to the technology, carries out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts, or can restrict specific transactions or exclude specific persons.\n\nUniversally Accessible\nUniversally accessible means that the technology supporting the decentralized network and its transactions must be publicly available through electronic devices without discrimination or special permission. All required software must be freely downloadable and any person may use the code and network to create applications for private or public purposes.";
