 *      data controller for any personal data processed through the Platform and must comply with all GDPR requirements, including obtaining valid consent, providing data subject access rights, 
 *      and implementing appropriate data protection measures.
 *      Deutsche Bank AG Convert Corporation logs all transactions and activities conducted on the Platform for audit and security purposes, as per regulatory requirements. The Licensee consents
